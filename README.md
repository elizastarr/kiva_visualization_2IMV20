# Kiva_visualization
TU/e Visualization assignment

#### Overview: 
We need to define a few interesting questions that can be answered using interactive visualizations
Filtering by Geography to see relation bt Kiva activity and countyâ€™s welfare etc.
1. What countries should Kiva target next? At needy countries with little Kiva activity or at needy countries with successful Kiva activity.
  - Where and what social/economic initiatives could Kiva invest in outside of the product to improve the quality of life for these entrepreneurs.
2. Filtering by type of borrower (sex, nationality, Kiva history) to see what borrowers are the most reliable, benefit the most, continue growing their business etc.
  - See #3. It is similar, but approaches the problem backwards.
3. Filtering through loans by quality to identify patterns of successful or unsuccessful loans.
  - What types of borrowers should be recommended to the loaners? This can help prevent situations where a loan is not paid back and a loaner stops investing because their money was not returned for reinvestment.
  - Why are these loans unsuccessful? What can be done to decrease unsuccessful cases?
